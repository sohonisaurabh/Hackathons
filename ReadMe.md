If you have questions on the challenges, ask in Vox directly and the ‘sensei’ will answer ASAP.
 
Based on what we’ve heard from last year’s participants, I will give you some advice.
    
1. DO NOT WAIT till the end of the week to complete your challenge. Many people wait till the last minute and find it tough to complete the challenges.
2. Remember the challenges are meant to make you research/read/try out. Read whatever you can related to the challenge even if they are peripheral to the topic and start a running bookmark that you can refer back to.
3. Look for ways to use what you learn with these challenges – perhaps in your project or by writing a blog, speaking in a team event etc. Make the most of your work.
