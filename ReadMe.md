The purpose of this document is to guide developers in setting up a project using Web APIs to control sensors such as Compass, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Camera, Speaker, Microphone and Bluetooth in-built in a smartphone. The project aims at controlling an integrated system such as a drone via Virtual Reality (VR) headset and provide first person view to the user as a part of feedback. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is achieved when users perform specific gestures in order interact with the drone and change its position and orientation.

Hello World app for following modules is included inside respective folders:

1. webrtc-videoplayback – Video streaming and playback using webRTC on same client machine.
2. stereoscopic-video-render – Conversion of 2D video to stereoscopic output for enhanced user experience with VR headset
3. deviceorientation-tracking – Sample app to access accelerometer and gyroscope sensor readings of a smartphone and output all axes values

Challenges faced in implementation and future implementation scope is documented in ReadMe file for each module.
